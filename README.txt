#Info About Panzer Shipyards

#Panzer Shipyards
My First Plugin because I am bored. So Decided to make my own plugin instead of modifying ship files.

# What is the Panzer Shipyards?

A group of isolated humans situated in the east of Free World's Capital and West of Republic space. They'll be balanced around the Heliarchs, Remnant, Korath Automatons, and interesting, distinctions.

For example, a weapon based on Fire Lance and a inhibitor cannon like particle cannon, a beam weapon that deals ion, disruption and slowing damage.
A EMP Missile System designed for disabling targets. some ships will have unbalanced stats such as the (PMS-10) which would a problem when in wolf like packs to destroy one ship.

# Who/what the Enslaved are?

Similar to humanoid monkeys (chimp-like people, i cannot think of names yet).
In climax of the story you'll know that they are enslaved by another supreme race in the name of "The Dominion" a empire of demon-like people who basically the Apex Predator of the galaxy the Enslaved that the Panzer Shipyard trying help to.

# What is the The Dominion

The demon-like people of the Holpa galaxy. they enslaved every sentient species in their galaxy and make them terminated when they don't need to.
They value the Bloodshed over honor. The Panzer Shipyards will become in Union of Species whom will be guiding the Holpa Galaxy when The Dominion is Defeated.

Strong as Quargs, Mighty as an Archon, and I'll willed like the Unfettered Hais that would called the Dominion. Their weaponry is not the similar you found on Galaxy not weird as Pugs, the ships they have is the strongest you found being light warship is strong as a Punisher, ship that are nearly strong as an Archon. you will feel the cold of their heart when they are here.

# Spoilers

Pugs will intervine in Holpa Galaxy.
